				<h3><u>Lessons learned:</u></h3>
				<p>
					The index page was created first as an experementation in animation with JavaScript, I had lots yet to learn hence the creation of the CSS and HTML was rushed and unplanned (as its main purpose was to give the Javascript something to run on), meaning that variables have not been intuitively named; This makes changing color schemes difficult. Therefore planning and design became an integral part of building new pages from this point on, responsive pages such as the Links Page would not have been possible without carefull consideration of design and variable naming.

				<h2><a href="../links/links.html">The Links Page</a></h2>
				<p>
					I am most proud of The Links page as it is designed resposivley (meaning the layout of the page changes to suit either desktop or mobile). After animating with JavaScript for the Index page I experemented with CSS Keyframe animation, finding this much simpler, it allowed the animations to be more complex, smooth and bouncy. However without the knowledge of CSS FlexBox (that I later learned and used for other parts of the page) aligning items was done in a strange way on this page, as you can see using Inspect Element on the buttons.

				<h2><a href="../quiz/quiz.html">The Quiz Selection</a></h2>
				<p>
					This page has two color schemes, and is designed in the style of a temple with pillars hence the creation of this page required elaborate CSS grid implementaion. This allows the page to easily accomodate 1 to 4 links with ease. However I would like to spend more time polishing the animations and text sizing, and I would like to make the page scrollable to accomodate more than three or four quiz links.

			<div class="para" id="quizes">
				<h2>Quizes</h2>
				<p>
					The heaviest implementaion of JavaScript is found in the three example quizes, as the question number automatically scales; the buttons both advance the quiz and keep a running total of score. Answers will randomly choose a button to display on, meaning that repeat tries wont be sped up by memorisation of the locations of the answers. The creation of new quizes is streamlined and seemless, three JS arrays are used for correct answers, incorrect answers, and the questions. This page is also responsive to different viewport sizes, however in testnig I have found that the JavaScript only partially works on Apple IOS devices, and text sizing still remains a core issue with the site.

				<h2>Limitations of this site</h2>
				<p>
					The site has been thoroughly tested on Microsoft edge, however more JavaScript will need to be implemented to allow for seemless deployment on other browsers. The development of this site paused on August 31st 2020 as effort would be better spent creating a new website from the ground up, with cleaner semantic code and site-wide theme options.
